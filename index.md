# About Me

Hi there! I'm Golshid Aflaki, a passionate statistician and an educator with a PhD in progress. I am a PhD candidate in the Data Science program at HEC Montreal, working on Mixture Models and Dependence Modeling under the supervision of [Professor Jean-François Plante](https://www.hec.ca/profs/jfplante.html) and Professor [Juliana Schulz](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/juliana.schulz.html). My interest in statistics stems from a deep love for blending academic rigor and real-world problem-solving. My current focus is on research and teaching statistics at HEC Montréal.

Let’s connect and solve data-driven challenges together.
